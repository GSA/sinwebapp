## S3

In production, the application uses the Amazon Web Services's Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) to store user uploaded PDF attachments. Credentials for S3 are delivered to the application through the <b>VCAP_SERVICES</b> environment variable on the Cloud environment. These credentials are passed to a python package, <b>boto3</b>, which integrates with the AWS S3 AP and provides an S3 client to interact with the S3 instance. 

The <i>/files/</i> module within the Django app provides a series of redirect endpoints for accessing the S3 instance. See API for more information.
